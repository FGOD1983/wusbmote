Initial release:
  - Supports the Wii Nunchuk at its full resolution (8 bit for the XY
    joystick and 10bit for the accelerometers)

  - Supports the Wii classic controller (Tested RVL-005 and RVL-005(-02).
    By default, the analogic L slider is disabled. Hold HOME for 3 seconds
	to toggle between enabled/disabled. (Required to complete button
	assignment in many games)

  - Partial support for the Wii motion plus. Connecting a peripheral to the
    Wii motion plus is NOT supported. Yaw, Roll and Pitch speeds scaled down
	to fit in the 10 bit USB report which severely limits precision.

  - The connected peripheral can be changed on the fly.
